# Portfolio One! (Repo - https://github.com/Carl-Lombardi/PortfolioOne) (Site - https://carl-lombardi.github.io/PortfolioOne/)
This is my first portfolio update. Included in it are links to Crystal Collector, New Jersey Devils Trivia and the first team project that I worked on. This project was known as Get Out!

## This site uses HTML, CSS, and links to sites using Materialize, Javascript and JQuery 
The basic build of the site was HTML/CSS with links to sites using Materialize (Get Out!) and Javascript/JQuery (Crystal Collector/New Jersey Devils Trivia).

## Features
This portfolio features an About Me page, a portfolio page with three linked projects (GitHub and Site Links) and a contact page with Github and LinkedIn links. On my LinkedIn, my Email address is noted. 

## Installation 
No outside software is needed for installation. 

## How to Use
This is a pretty straight forward portfolio with all working links. 

## Issues and Solutions
There were not a lot of issues in creating the portfolio. The biggest issue was compiling all links together and writing Read-Mes. 

## Credits
This portfolio was created, written and developed by Carl Lombardi.
